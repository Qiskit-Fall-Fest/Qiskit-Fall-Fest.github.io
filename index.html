        <p>
          Join us for an exciting, global celebration of quantum computing 
          innovation. The Qiskit Fall Fest is an annual event that brings 
          together students, researchers, and enthusiasts from around the 
          world to explore the cutting-edge world of quantum technologies. 

          For the first time, in collaboration with IBM Quantum, the CS Committee 
          from the bachelor program of Ecole Polytechnique has brought this event 
          to Paris. Featuring hands-on workshops, hackathons, and expert-led 
          sessions, the event will showcase the power of Qiskit—an open-source 
          quantum computing framework—and its transformative potential across 
          various industries. 

          The event is designed for everyone—from complete beginners to experienced 
          quantum enthusiasts. Whether you're just hearing about quantum computing 
          for the first time or already familiar with the field, this global celebration 
          offers something for you. With beginner-friendly workshops, hands-on coding 
          sessions, and expert guidance, you'll learn how to use Qiskit, an open-source 
          quantum computing framework, and gain real-world skills. No prior knowledge 
          required—come join us and discover how you can be part of the quantum revolution!
